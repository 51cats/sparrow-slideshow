This is a simple Javascript slideshow experiment with music.

I got the music at freemusicarchive.org.

Track 1: Sense the Wind by Lee Rosevere.
Track 2: [No Title] by Bill Cheathum.
Track 3: Parisian by Kevin MacLeod.
Track 4: Veloma by Fabrizio Paterlini.

I don't know jQuery, and I don't know if this slideshow will work on all web browsers or on all display devices such as cellphones. I guess we'll see.
